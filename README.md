# Proxy 
#### Add this in client **package.json** file

Our server sending request in port 5000 but our client is running on port 3000 .So,we added proxy in package.json so that it will sends internal request to 5000 and pretending like both are running on the same PORT
> {
> "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
> }

# To Run

#### Run both client and Server
> npm run dev

#### Run the server 
> nodemon appname

#### Run the client 
> npm start

##### # Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
